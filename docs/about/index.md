# About me

Hi! I'm Antonio, I'm in road to become a product developer specialized in agriculture and technology transference, 

[You can find my portfolio here.](https://kny5.github.io/personal_portfolio/ "personal website")



## My background

I started my professional career as a CAD/CAM technician in the plastics manufacturing industry in 2007 while studying aeronautical engineering.

In 2014, I changed to developing control systems for greenhouses in southern Mexico as freelancer, and I got accepted to my first MIT program, the Global Startup Labs Bootcamp in 2015. I learned human-center design, and I've explored since then technology transference for agriculture.

I've acquired skills in rapid prototyping while studying in Product design innovation programs and collaborating with international initiatives of the MIT in Mexico. I've been also a teacher for Jacaranda Education and the Access Education program of the U.S. Embassy in Mexico.

I've volunteered to mentor technology-based social initiatives, government institutions, universities, and foreign organizations working in Mexico promoting education and gender equality for indigenous populations.

I've been a Linux user and evangelist since 2006, for the Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora distributions.

In 2020, I was part of the [Hackaday Prize 2020 Dream teams](https://hackaday.com/2020/07/10/dream-team-members-announced-for-the-2020-hackaday-prize/). Where I worked to help [Field Ready]() an international NFP Organization to develop a remote quality control system for humanitarian aid products, that are made mostly in FabLabs in countries were disaster relief is very important.

So, when someone asks me what do I do for a living, I say, I'm a product developer at the convergence between hacking, design, and the pyramid base economy.



## Work on the Open Quality control standard document

The main purpose of this project is to provide a quick and reliable traceability system for products made in Fab Labs, taking in consideration risk, supply chain, and tracking the: human-machine-material data of any product.
