# 12. Molding and casting

## Introduction

For this week we need to:

1. Mill a mold using our available [CNC machine](http://fabacademy.org/2021/labs/agrilab/group/week_8_cnc/).
2. Cast an object using the milled mold.
3. Test materials for the [group assignment](http://fabacademy.org/2021/labs/agrilab/group/week12/)

Things I've learn so far:

- 3D modeling for molding.
- Process 3D CNC operations.
- Machining Wax bricks for molds.
- Calculate volume of material needed.
- Mix food-safe silicone.
- Cast silicon.
- Use the vacuum chamber.



## 3D design on Fusion

Model based in this two pieces found in Agrilab:

## Preparation prior to Milling process

The milling process requires the Wax brick to be fixed to the [CNC bed](http://fabacademy.org/2021/labs/agrilab/group/week_8_cnc/). But the WAX brick dimensions doesn't coincide with the pattern in the bed that holds pieces using the vacuum pump.

So, we had the task to design a holding tool, for that I've measure the CNC bed.

In the milling day I've used Theo's holder for the 75 x 176 x 37 mm Wax brick
