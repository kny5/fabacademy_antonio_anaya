#### Security assessment:

**Plastic particles in air:**

As in the printing process we are heating plastics and then use a fan to cooldown the layers it's very important to know that we're actually emitting dangerous plastic particles to the air.

So to prevent any hazardous environment follow this basic checklist:

1. Avoid the use of dangerous materials like ABS, instead try to use PLA if the mechanical properties are not important for your piece.
2. Use a HEPA air filter system in the room and keep it turn on while printing in the room. Keep a good maintenance of the filter, replacing or washing periodically the filter cartridges.
3. Once your printing is running and everything seems working fine, stay away from the room.
4. After every work ventilate the room by opening the windows.
5. If possible work with a closed cased 3D printer.
6. If you need to stay close in the same room of the printer for large amounts of time, use a face mask or particle gas mask.

**Fire risk:**

As the FDM printing process requires high temperatures to melt the plastic, there's some risk associated to the usage of the machine.

Checklist to prevent fires while 3D printing:

1. Check that the heat sensors work correctly.
2. Look for any sign of wearing of the insulation that covers the nozzle.
3. Look for any melted parts of the 3D printer that can indicate a over-high temperature.
4. Take a look at the board components and try to identify any over heating on the motor drivers.
5. Use safe temperature materials, there are some exotic mixes that require higher temperatures.
6. Check that all the cooling fans are working correctly.
7. Check if you have the right setttings for the material.
8. Try to split large models into ~8 to 10 hours parts.
9. Avoid prints that are very long.
10. Install [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/) or [astroprint](https://www.astroprint.com/) to monitor online your prints.
11. Place the 3D printer in a safe environment far away from any fast combustion materials or any other temperature sensitive chemicals.
12. Have a fire extinguisher at hand.

**Cross contamination:**

There are some people interested on food-safe or biomedical 3D printing parts. But there's some risk associated to the FDM process that makes very difficult to make safe printed parts.

Food-safe manufacturing checklist:

1. Change the brass extruder nozzle for one made of lead-free staninless steel.
2. Use a closed cased 3D printer.
3. Use a lead-free glass for the printer bed.
4. Use a lead-free material.
5. Print with the higher resolution to reduce the ammount of porosity on the part surface.
6. For posprocessing you can cover the part with Teflon, Transparent resin or try electroplating.

Food-safe use of 3D printed parts:

1. Clean inmediately after every usage, to avoid the food impregnate on the part surface.
2. Don't put any reactive substance in the 3D printed part.
3. If you're using a dishwashing machine, check the temperatures to avoid any deformation on the part.
4. Be conscious that there's no possibility to have a long-lasting 3D print part, so you need to dispose the part after it shows signs of wearing in the food-safe coating.
