### Project description:

Challenge:

To develop an affordable device for cow milk production measurement and quality checking.

Characteristics:

- Supply-chain reduced components.
- Food-safe components for the parts in contact with the milk.
- Adaptable to different countries and their local regulations or tech level.

Functions:

- Read RFID current existing earrings
- Meassure automatically ammount of milk produced for each animal on a production.
- Meassure a sample for milk quality control.

Parts:

- 4 Milk flow meter on for each cow's udder.
- RFID earring reader.
- Spectral sensor for substance identification
- Dielectric spectroscopy sensor.

User:

- Field veterinary technicians.
- Dairy production managers.
- Researchers.
- Quality control technicians.
