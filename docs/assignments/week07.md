# 7. Electronics design

It might be a video for this week... depending on Monday's work.

**A few notes for this week about documentation:**

Working in a FabLab is not an easy task, as much as I like to learn, I can't learn everything, and my ambitions not always reach my outcome in work and documentation. So for this week I've made this list of recommendations to get easily into the documentation process to help me out to have a structure, and with the hope to help others struggling under similar conditions.

[Check my notes on my new Tips section.](../../Tips/documentation_tips/)



## Introduction:





### Electronic components:

#### Resistor:

![Resistor code table](../../images/week07/component_01.jpg)

Formula:

> Ohms Law: Resistance = Voltage / Current

> Example for a 2V, 0.02A LED in a 5 Volts Power Supply: 5V - 2V = 3V; 3V / 0.02A = 150 Ohm

> It's a passive electrical component that holds **resistance** to the conductivity of an electrical current.



#### Capacitor:

Formula:

> Example for a 2V, 0.02A LED in a 5 Volts Power Supply: 5V - 2V = 3V; 3V / 0.02A = 150 Ohm

> It's a passive electrical component that holds **resistance** to the conductivity of an electrical current.



#### Regulator:

#### Diode:

#### Micro-controller:

### Schematics Design:

### Footprints:

### Board design:

## Kicad:

**Requirements:**

1. Install KiCad
2. Download or clone Fab Academy Kicad Library.
3. Add Symbol and Footprints libraries.
4. Add [Luc]() and [Florent]() USB and JTAG KiCad footprint files.
5. [SAMD11 datasheet.]()
6. [SAMD11 pinout information.](github.com/)
7. Look for availability of components in your local inventory.



### Installation:


On Fedora Linux:

```
sudo dnf install kicad

```


Cloning Fab Academy Library repository:

```
git clone https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/pub/libraries/electronics/kicad.git
```
