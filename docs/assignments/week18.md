# 18. Invention, Intellectual Property and Business Models.


## Context

I've been working closely with agricultural technicians for the last 8 years in Mexico. During this time I've realized the many challenges associated to the supply chain of reliable tools, the accessibility of data management platforms and the complexity of the existent solutions.

For this reason I've developed my final project focused on bringing an easy to access tool to help increase the reliability of milk produced by small farmers in under developed countries such as Mexico.

## Dissemination plan

This project its currently supported by:

- [AgriLab](https://agrilab.unilasalle.fr) in France.

- [The office for science and technology of the government of Chiapas state in Mexico.](https://icti.chiapas.gob.mx/)

- [The MIT Global Startup Labs program.](https://gsl.mit.edu/).

The project its expected to have a trial and usage in 2022 in Chiapas State in Mexico in the Ocozocuautla region, with the help of the local dairy producers association.

During the next months I'll apply to different seed funding initiatives to help me out continue the development of the device.

In the last year I've also know [Field Ready](https://www.fieldready.org/) and designed a system for tracking devices manufactured mostly in fablabs around the world with the purpose to help people in difficult environments under disaster by climate, or war.

I've also collaborated with [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com) during the [Hackaday Prize 2020](https://hackaday.com/2020/07/10/dream-team-members-announced-for-the-2020-hackaday-prize/) and [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org) and got the understanding of the requirements for open-source scientific kits.

My plan summarizes in this points:

- Trial in 2022 in Chiapas, Mexico.
- Develop further towards an scientific kit.
- Open source resources.
- Look out for team mates.
- Distributing the resources through Hackaday, Field Ready and PublicLab.
- Search for seed funding towards a commercial product development.



## Equipment

For the next phase the project will require the hosting by a FabLab with the following list of equipment:

- Electronics lab with a sufficient inventory for microcontroller board developments and prototypes.
- Roland Roland SRM 20 milling machine or certified chemical etching working area.
- Prusa Mk3 3D printer.
- 120 m wide Laser cutter machine.
- Materials and connectors inventory.

Another possibility its to acquire the equipment but that will increase the cost of the production by more than 20'000 USD.



## Trials

The trial will be performed by veterinary technicians from public and private institutions dedicated to monitor the quality of dairy productions in the central Region of Chiapas in Mexico.

Schedule:

- Starting in January 2022.
- First cut in March 2022.
- Prototype 2 in April 2022.
- Second trial in May 2022.
- Second cut in Jun 2022.
- Prototype 3 in July 2022.



## Slide and Video for final presentation

The final presentation of the project to Professor [Neil Gershenfeld](https://www.wikiwand.com/fr/Neil_Gershenfeld) was scheduled for June 16th 2021 11:00 hrs Boston time.
