# 3. Computer Aided design

Description: CAD stands for Computer Aided Design, there are different solutions for different industries, like AutoCAD specialized in the mechanical and architecture industry, CATIA for the aircraft, maritime and automobile industry, or Blender specialized in digital art.

There are also differences in licensing, for example proprietary software CATIA, but there are also Open Sourced and Libre solutions like Blender, FreeCAD and OpenScad, that are driven by their communities.


## Ideation:

The first thing I've made was this sort of ideation process to define the parts of my project an this is the end-result.

## Measuring objects:

I give myself the challenge to draw one of the earrings used for Cow identification in UniLaSalle:

## Image compression and improvement with Gimp:

I used Gimp to crop, scale and compress all images shown in this assignment page.

## Xdesign:

Review:

I've learned Xdesign and I found it very complicated at first even as a Solidworks user. My main OS is Linux and I've made this list to make Xdesign work fluid and efficiently.

Linux recommendations:
Chromium works better than Firefox.
Activate Hardware acceleration.
Force hardware GPU use.*

*For Nvidia Nouveau drivers use:
```
DRI_PRIME=1 chromium-browser
```

*For Nvidia propietary drivers, use Bumblebee:

```
optirun chromium-browser
```

### 3D modeling:

There are four basic operations as principles for 3D modeling:
<ol>
<li>2D Drafting for sketching.</li>
<li>Linear region extrusion.</li>
<li>Linear region extraction.</li>
<li>One axis profile revolution.</li>
<li>Parametric scaling.</li>
</ol>






I've used all this to produce the model shown:

In order to used

### Model video:
