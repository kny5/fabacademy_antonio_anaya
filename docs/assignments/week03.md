# 3. Computer Aided design

Description: CAD stands for Computer Aided Design, there are different solutions for different industries, like AutoCAD specialized in the mechanical and architecture industry, CATIA for the aircraft, maritime and automobile industry, or Blender specialized in digital art.

There are also differences in licensing, for example proprietary software CATIA, but there are also Open Sourced and Libre solutions like Blender, FreeCAD and OpenScad, that are driven by their communities.


## Ideation:

The first thing I've made was this sort of ideation process to define the parts of my project an this is the end-result.
